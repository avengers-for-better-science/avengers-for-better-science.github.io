# Program

To achieve our goal of bringing early career researchers from several disciplines together, we propose to work towards a common deliverable - **an open source lab/group/community manual**, which can be used both by workshop participants and others. Each day of the workshop will be dedicated to one theme. Each day will start with the chair introducing the theme. Then we will have one or more talks on specific issues related to the theme. The remainder of the time will be reserved for small groups working together in an unconference/discussion format, and contributing to the manual. On the last day we will review our manual and discuss future plans. 

The preliminary schedule is as follows (check again soon for updates):

| Day, date             | Topic & Chairs                                                | Planned Talks                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
