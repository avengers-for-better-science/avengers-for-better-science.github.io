# Avengers for Better Science!

Avengers for Better Science is a workshop organized to support young researchers committed to building an inclusive, open and ethical academia. The event will focus on communities related to machine learning and life science. 

We will spend five days doing science and learning from each other, in a form of a retreat (a.k.a. unconference or hackathon). Rather than listening to talks, the organizers provide a context, in which other participants learn from each other while doing online and/or offline activities. Each day will be dedicated to a specific theme.

To achieve our goal of bringing early career researchers from several disciplines together, we will work towards a common deliverable - **an open source lab/group/community manual**.
